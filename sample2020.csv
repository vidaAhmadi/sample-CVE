The so called 2-level event channelmodel imposes different limits on the number of usable event channels for32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either bitness) ones. 32-bit x86domains can use only 1023 channels, due to limited space in their shared(between guest and Xen) information structure, whereas all other domainscan use up to 4095 in this model. The recording of the respective limitduring domain initialization, however, has occurred at a time where domainsare still deemed to be 64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respectivedomain properties. At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, thelimit didn't get updated accordingly. Due to this misbehavior in Xen,32-bit domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may observeevent channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail.Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly lead tocorruption of other parts of the shared info structure.

In Nanopbbefore versions 0.4.4 and 0.3.9.7, decoding specifically formed message canleak memory if dynamic allocation is enabled and an oneof field contains astatic submessage that contains a dynamic field, and the message beingdecoded contains the submessage multiple times. This is rare in normalmessages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This is fixedin versions 0.3.9.7 and 0.4.4. The following workarounds are available: 1)Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This will generate fieldsas separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic code.2) Set the type of the submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. Thisway the whole submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematiccode is not executed. 3) Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sureall memory can be released afterwards.;Link: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2020/CVE-2020-26243; CVE-2020-26243;Priority: medium;Description:Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation.

 CVE-2020-15250;Priority: Medium;Description: In JUnit4 from version 4.7 and before 4.13.1, the test rule TemporaryFoldercontains a local information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix likesystems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users onthat system. Because of this, when files and directories are written intothis directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that samesystem. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite thecontents of these directories or files. This is purely an informationdisclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit testswrite sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporaryfolder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS hasother untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only addedin JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you areusing. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must usethe workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running onJava 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to adirectory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix thisvulnerability.

 CVE-2020-29484;Priority: Medium;Description: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When a Xenstore watch fires,the xenstore client that registered the watch will receive a Xenstoremessage containing the path of the modified Xenstore entry that triggeredthe watch, and the tag that was specified when registering the watch. Anycommunication with xenstored is done via Xenstore messages, consisting of amessage header and the payload. The payload length is limited to 4096bytes. Any request to xenstored resulting in a response with a payloadlonger than 4096 bytes will result in an error. When registering a watch,the payload length limit applies to the combined length of the watched pathand the specified tag. Because watches for a specific path are alsotriggered for all nodes below that path, the payload of a watch eventmessage can be longer than the payload needed to register the watch. Amalicious guest that registers a watch using a very large tag (i.e., with aregistration operation payload length close to the 4096 byte limit) cancause the generation of watch events with a payload length larger than 4096bytes, by writing to Xenstore entries below the watched path. This willresult in an error condition in xenstored. This error can result in a NULLpointer dereference, leading to a crash of xenstored. A malicious guestadministrator can cause xenstored to crash, leading to a denial of service.Following a xenstored crash, domains may continue to run, but managementoperations will be impossible.

 CVE-2020-1971;Priority: High;"Description: The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing differenttypes of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSLprovides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances ofa GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behavesincorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointerdereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of serviceattack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes:1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and aCRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifyingthat a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name(exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response andTS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being comparedthen that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker cantrick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against amalicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applicationsautomatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. Thischecking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL beingverified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support forthe ""-crl_download"" option which implements automatic CRL downloading andthis attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that anunrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse orconstruct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible toconstruct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept andhence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions areaffected by this issue.

 CVE-2020-15157;Priority: Medium;Description: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before version1.2.14 there is a credential leaking vulnerability. If a container imagemanifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 formatincludes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise knownas a ‚Äúforeign layer‚Äù), the default containerd resolver will follow that URLto attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the defaultcontainerd resolver will provide its authentication credentials if theserver where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code along withregistry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker publishes a public imagewith a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a webserver they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image,they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases,this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In othercases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instancewhich can grant access to other cloud resources in the account. The defaultcontainerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be usedby Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs thathave explicitly linked against it.

 CVE-2020-10713;Priority: High;Description: A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use theGRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flawalso allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load anuntrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need to establishaccess to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain the ability toalter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a networked system withroot access.

 CVE-2020-5260;Priority: Medium;"Description: Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be trickedinto sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Gituses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwordsor other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system.Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can injectunintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing thecredential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g.,good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g.,evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent tothe latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two,meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present storedcredentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability canbe triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affectedURLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systemswhich automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Gitsubmodules, or package systems built around Git.

 CVE-2020-15134;Priority: Medium;Description: Faye before version 1.4.0, there is a lack of certification validation inTLS handshakes. Faye uses em-http-request and faye-websocket in the Rubyversion of its client. Those libraries both use the`EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLShandshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This methoddoes not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that itdoes not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificatefor the expected hostname. That means that any `https:` or `wss:`connection made using these libraries is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middleattack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server it isconnected to. The first request a Faye client makes is always sent vianormal HTTP, but later messages may be sent via WebSocket. Therefore it isvulnerable to the same problem that these underlying libraries are, and weneeded both libraries to support TLS verification before Faye could claimto do the same. Your client would still be insecure if its initial HTTPSrequest was verified, but later WebSocket connections were not. This isfixed in Faye v1.4.0, which enables verification by default.

Only guests with passed through PCI devices may be able to leverage the vulnerability. Only systems passing through devices with out-of-spec (""backdoor"") functionality can cause issues. Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality is common; unless you have reason to believe that your device does not have such functionality, it's better to assume that it does.";Link: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25595

In a cluster with an IPv4internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (viaipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured orconfigured on some interfaces, but it's pretty likely that ipv6 forwardingis disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default,/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctlsmeans that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6stack using them. By sending rogue router advertisements, an attacker canreconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of thehost to the attacker controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, manyHTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4,giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond. If by chance you alsohave on the host a vulnerability like last year's RCE in apt(CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host.

Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond. If by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year's RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host. Weave Net version 2.6.3 disables the accept_ra option on the veth devices that it creates.;Link: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11091; CVE-2020-11091;CVSS 2.0: 3.5 LOW;CVSS 3.x: 5.8 MEDIUM;Published_date: 06/03/2020;Description: In Weave Net before version 2.6.3, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service. In a cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it's pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them. By sending rogue router advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container.

 CVE-2020-1938;Priority: Low;Description: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken whentrusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJPconnections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTPconnection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can beexploited in ways that may be surprising.

This is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix: ""jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/"".";Link: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26275
