 CVE-2019-17638;Priority: Medium;Description: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.4.27.v20200227 to 9.4.29.v20200521, in case oftoo large response headers, Jetty throws an exception to produce an HTTP431 error. When this happens, the ByteBuffer containing the HTTP responseheaders is released back to the ByteBufferPool twice. Because of thisdouble release, two threads can acquire the same ByteBuffer from the pooland while thread1 is about to use the ByteBuffer to write response1 data,thread2 fills the ByteBuffer with other data. Thread1 then proceeds towrite the buffer that now contains different data. This results in client1,which issued request1 seeing data from another request or response whichcould contain sensitive data belonging to client2 (HTTP session ids,authentication credentials, etc.).

 CVE-2019-6475;Priority: Medium;Description: Mirror zones are a BIND feature allowing recursive servers to pre-cachezone data provided by other servers. A mirror zone is similar to a zone oftype secondary, except that its data is subject to DNSSEC validation beforebeing used in answers, as if it had been looked up via traditionalrecursion, and when mirror zone data cannot be validated, BIND falls backto using traditional recursion instead of the mirror zone. However, anerror in the validity checks for the incoming zone data can allow anon-path attacker to replace zone data that was validated with a configuredtrust anchor with forged data of the attacker's choosing. The mirror zonefeature is most often used to serve a local copy of the root zone. If anattacker was able to insert themselves into the network path between arecursive server using a mirror zone and a root name server, thisvulnerability could then be used to cause the recursive server to accept acopy of falsified root zone data. This affects BIND versions 9.14.0 up to9.14.6, and 9.15.0 up to 9.15.4.;Link: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-6475; CVE-2019-6475;Priority: Medium;Description: Mirror zones are a BIND feature allowing recursive servers to pre-cachezone data provided by other servers.

 CVE-2019-10639;Priority: Medium;Description: The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allowsInformation Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to aKASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernelimage offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-lessprotocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multipledestination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (ofindices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (viaenumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of astatic variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offsetof the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, bythe attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certainother) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server tosend UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic istrivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For clienttargets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUICcan be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses.

XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's ""assignable-add"" feature to prepare devices to be assigned to untrusted guests. Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required step for device assignment. The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki describes alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt uses its own ways as well. Hosts where these ""alternate"" methods are used will still leave the system in a vulnerable state after the device comes back from a guest. An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable.

On Linux and other systems that support ""saved UID"" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use ""enable -f"" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.";Link: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18276

Error handling for a bad format character was done using BUG(), which crashes Xen. One path, via the VCPUOP_initialise hypercall, has a bad format character. The BUG() can be hit if VCPUOP_initialise executes for a sufficiently long period of time for a continuation to be created. Malicious guests may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen versions 4.6 and newer are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.5 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. HVM and PVH guests, and guests on ARM systems, cannot exploit the vulnerability.;Link: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18420

 CVE-2019-1543;Priority: Low;Description: ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input forevery encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV)should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length andfront pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However italso incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this caseonly the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes areignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values areunique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible toserious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changesthe default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a changeto the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a newunique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messageswith a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are notcovered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application thatrelies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce maybe further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including inSSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. Howeveruser applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default noncelength to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue.
